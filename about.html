    <h2>About Our Cloud Kitchen</h2>

    <p>
      Food is not just about filling hunger. It is about comfort, routine, health,
      and trust. Our cloud kitchen was created with this simple belief — to prepare
      honest, home-style meals and deliver them fresh to people who may not have the
      time or energy to cook every day.
    </p>

    <p>
      We operate as a cloud kitchen, which means we focus entirely on cooking and
      delivery. There is no dine-in space, no restaurant seating, and no distractions.
      This allows us to give our complete attention to what matters most: ingredient
      quality, cleanliness, consistency, and timely delivery.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, we have learned that many people are not looking for fancy presentation
      or complicated dishes. They want food that feels familiar, balanced, and reliable —
      food that can be eaten every day without feeling heavy or unhealthy.
    </p>

        <h3>Why a Cloud Kitchen</h3>

        <p>
          The idea of a cloud kitchen came from observing daily food habits of working
          professionals, students, and families. Many people leave home early, return
          late, or manage long work hours. Cooking every day becomes difficult, and
          outside food often feels oily, spicy, or inconsistent.
        </p>

        <p>
          A cloud kitchen allows us to remove unnecessary overheads like dining space
          and focus purely on cooking. This helps us maintain reasonable pricing while
          still using good-quality ingredients.
        </p>

        <p>
          By working only with delivery orders, we prepare food in controlled batches,
          reduce waste, and ensure freshness for every meal sent out.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Approach to Food</h3>

        <p>
          Our food is inspired by everyday South Indian home cooking. The recipes are
          simple, familiar, and balanced. We avoid excessive oil, artificial colors,
          and unnecessary additives.
        </p>

        <p>
          We believe food should not feel heavy after eating. It should give energy
          without discomfort. That is why we focus on:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Proper cooking methods</li>
          <li>Balanced use of spices</li>
          <li>Seasonal vegetables</li>
          <li>Simple gravies and preparations</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Instead of following trends, we follow practices that have worked for
          generations.

        <h3>Ingredients and Hygiene</h3>

        <p>
          Ingredients play a major role in how food tastes and how the body responds
          to it. We try to use fresh vegetables, quality rice, lentils, and basic
          spices commonly used in home kitchens.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cleanliness is one of the most important parts of our kitchen operations.
          Since our food is meant for daily consumption, hygiene cannot be compromised.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Clean cooking surfaces</li>
          <li>Proper washing of vegetables</li>
          <li>Separate handling of veg and non-veg items</li>
          <li>Clean storage containers</li>
          <li>Regular cleaning of utensils</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We believe good food begins with a clean kitchen — every single day.
