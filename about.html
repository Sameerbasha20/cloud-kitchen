    <div class="about-content">

      <p>
        Food is not just about filling hunger. It is about comfort, routine,
        health, and trust. Our cloud kitchen was created with this simple belief —
        to prepare honest, home-style meals and deliver them fresh to people who
        may not have the time or energy to cook every day.
      </p>

      <p>
        We operate as a cloud kitchen, which means we focus entirely on cooking
        and delivery. There is no dine-in space, no restaurant seating, and no
        distractions. This allows us to give our complete attention to what
        matters most: ingredient quality, cleanliness, consistency, and timely
        delivery.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, we have learned that many people are not looking for fancy
        presentation or complicated dishes. They want food that feels familiar,
        balanced, and reliable — food that can be eaten every day without feeling
        heavy or unhealthy. Our kitchen exists to meet that need.
      </p>

      <h3>Why a Cloud Kitchen</h3>

      <p>
        The idea of a cloud kitchen came from observing daily food habits of
        working professionals, students, and families. Many people leave home
        early, return late, or manage long work hours. Cooking every day becomes
        difficult, and outside food often feels oily, spicy, or inconsistent.
      </p>

      <p>
        A cloud kitchen allows us to remove unnecessary overheads like dining
        space and focus purely on cooking. This model helps us maintain reasonable
        pricing while still using good-quality ingredients. It also allows us to
        manage portions carefully and plan meals that are suitable for regular
        consumption.
      </p>

      <p>
        By working only with delivery orders, we are able to prepare food in
        controlled batches, reduce waste, and ensure freshness for every meal
        sent out.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Approach to Food</h3>

      <p>
        Our food is inspired by everyday South Indian home cooking. The recipes
        are simple, familiar, and balanced. We avoid excessive oil, artificial
        colors, and unnecessary additives. Each meal is prepared keeping
        digestion, nutrition, and taste in mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe food should not feel heavy after eating. It should give energy
        without discomfort. That is why we focus on:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Proper cooking methods</li>
        <li>Balanced use of spices</li>
        <li>Seasonal vegetables</li>
        <li>Simple gravies and preparations</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Instead of following trends, we follow practices that have worked for
        generations.
      </p>

      <h3>Ingredients and Sourcing</h3>

      <p>
        Ingredients play a major role in how food tastes and how the body
        responds to it. We try to use fresh vegetables, quality rice, lentils,
        and basic spices that are commonly used in home kitchens.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vegetables are selected based on availability and season. This helps
        maintain freshness and avoids overuse of preserved items. Spices are
        used in moderate quantities, mainly for flavor and digestion rather than
        heat.
      </p>

      <p>
        We do not believe in over-complicating food. Our ingredient list remains
        simple, familiar, and transparent.
      </p>

      <h3>Hygiene and Kitchen Practices</h3>

      <p>
        Cleanliness is one of the most important parts of our kitchen operations.
        Since our food is meant for daily consumption, hygiene cannot be
        compromised.
      </p>

      <p>Our kitchen follows basic hygiene practices such as:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Clean cooking surfaces</li>
        <li>Proper washing of vegetables</li>
        <li>Separate handling of vegetarian and non-vegetarian items</li>
        <li>Clean storage containers</li>
        <li>Regular cleaning of utensils and work areas</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We believe that good food begins with a clean kitchen. Even simple dishes
        can feel unsafe if hygiene is ignored. That is something we take
        seriously every day.
